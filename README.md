Perfect 👍 I’ll clean it up further and remove the **Screenshots** and **Future Improvements** sections.
Here’s your final **simple, professional README**:

# 🚌 Ghost Bus Detector

A real-time bus tracking and anomaly detection system that helps identify **ghost buses** (buses that appear on schedules but don’t actually arrive) and other irregularities. This project uses **FastAPI, Redis, React, and WebSockets** to fetch, process, and visualize bus data on an interactive map.

This is my **first project**, built to learn how backend, frontend, and live data pipelines work together in real-world applications.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔴 Detect **ghost buses** in real-time
* 📡 Live bus tracking on an interactive **Leaflet map**
* 📊 **Bus trend chart** to visualize activity patterns
* ⚠️ **Alerts & notifications** when anomalies occur
* 🔍 Filters to view specific buses and statuses
* 📌 Click on a bus to see detailed information

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

* React.js
* Leaflet (Map visualization)
* WebSockets (real-time updates)

**Backend:**

* FastAPI (Python)
* Redis (Data caching)
* GTFS-Realtime (Bus feed integration)

**Other Tools:**

* NPM / Node.js
* Git & GitHub

## ⚡ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamP7769/Ghost-Bus-Detector.git
cd Ghost-Bus-Detector
```

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup (FastAPI + Redis)

1. Navigate to backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The backend will now run on:
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup (React)

1. Open a new terminal and go to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will now run on:
👉 `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The backend fetches bus data using **GTFS-Realtime API**.
2. Data is processed and anomalies (ghost buses, missing buses, delays) are detected.
3. The data is stored in **Redis** and served to the frontend via **WebSockets**.
4. The React app displays buses on a **map**, along with alerts and trend charts.

✅ Now your README is short, clean, and professional.

Do you want me to also **add a “Demo” section with instructions for deployment (Heroku/Render + Vercel/Netlify)** so others can easily try it out online?
